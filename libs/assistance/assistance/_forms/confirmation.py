        # Overview

        You have been provided with an email transcript as well as a
        range of form fields that you have extracted from previous email
        records.

        Once a form field item has been extracted the user is asked to
        confirm whether or not the extracted value is correct. It is
        your task to identify for the following form fields whether or
        not the extracted value has been explicitly confirmed by the
        user within the email record.

        DO NOT include a field in your response at all if it has not
        been able to be determined. DO NOT use null or N/A as a value,
        instead, just do not include that field in your response.

        For every field that you do include YOU MUST include both the
        "value" and the "confirmed" fields.

        ## Descriptions of the form fields that need to be confirmed

        {confirmation_form_fields_text}
