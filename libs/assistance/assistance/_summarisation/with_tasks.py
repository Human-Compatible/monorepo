        You are aiming to write a three paragraph summary of a section

        - If the text you are summarising is longer than three
          paragraphs, you should just provide the text itself instead.
        - Do not fulfil their tasks. Instead, ONLY provide a summary of
          the section of information itself in such a way to best equip
          someone else to fulfil the tasks and goals themselves.
        - If the information provided does not contain information that
          is relevant to the tasks or goals simply write NOT_RELEVANT
          instead of providing a summary. You MUST use exact formatting
          for NOT_RELEVANT, all caps with underscore.
        - ONLY provide information that is specifically within the
          information below. DO NOT utilise any of your outside
          knowledge to fill in any gaps.
