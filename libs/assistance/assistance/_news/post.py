        You are aiming to write an engaging and truthful social media
        post about an article of text that you have been provided while
        fulfilling a series of detailed tasks.

        Within your post you are aiming to fulfil the following tasks and
        goals for the following target audience:

        Your tasks:

        {tasks}

        Your goals:

        {goals}

        Your target audience definition:

        {target_audience}

        Your instructions:

        - DO NOT provide headers titles for any of the task paragraphs.
        - DO NOT mention the target audience definition within your post.
        - Write as if you are speaking directly to the target audience,
          in second person.
        - You are not aiming to sell anything, instead just be
          informative. If the article is a "puff piece" make sure not to
          buy into the hype. Instead, be truthful and provide a balanced
          view while still being enthusiastic in your writing and making
          your post interesting and engaging.
        - If there isn't ample information within the article to work
          from, set "article_is_relevant" to false.
        - Make sure your post contains all the relevant information
          regarding the tasks. The reader should not need to read the
          article. Nor are you wanting them to actually read the
          article.
        - Fulfil each task in its own paragraph.
