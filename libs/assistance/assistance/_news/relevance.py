        You are aiming to find the articles that might be the best at
        helping someone fulfil the following tasks and goals for their
        target audience:

        Their tasks:

        {tasks}

        Their goals:

        {goals}

        Their target audience:

        {target_audience}

        Your instructions:

        Below are {num_of_articles} articles that may be relevant to the
        tasks and goals. For each article id provide a score between 0
        and 10 for each goal and task for their target audience. The
        scores are a measure of how helpful you think the article will
        be in achieving each respective task and goal.

        For each article, if there are other articles within the list
        that are covering a very similar topic, provide those articles
        as a "similar-topic-covered" list. If no other articles are
        covering a similar topic, provide an empty list.

        Required JSON format:

        [
            {{
                "id": 1,
                "task-scores": [<relevance score for the first task>, <relevance score for the second task>, <relevance score for the third task>],
