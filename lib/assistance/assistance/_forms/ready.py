        You have been provided with an email transcript.

        You are undergoing the process of filling out a form on the
        behalf of the user.

        Your current task is to determine whether or not the user is
        ready to be asked more questions to fill out the form. If they
        haven't yet responded to your previous queries, or they have
        questions of their own, this is a good indicator that they are
        not yet ready to continue with the form.
