        You have been provided with a list of questions. You are to
        determine if there are any questions that would be benefited by
        having another question answered first.

        Provide a list of all the question ids that would be of benefit
        to the current question, and therefore should be asked before
        the current question.

        If there would be no questions that would be benefited the
        current question, then you should respond with an empty list.
